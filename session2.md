1.Given a sorted array of integers and a target, find if thereâ€™s a pair of elements that add up to the target. 
Return true if such a pair can be found, and false otherwise.


Brute force - Use of two loops
Optimal approach :
1. Use of hashmap
2. Two pointer approach
O(n2) could be simplified or optimized using 2 pointer approach to O(n) so we should always try it.
One pointer at the first second pointer at the last.
